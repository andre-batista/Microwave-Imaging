This is my repository where I store data and reports from my researchs regarding *Microwave Imaging*. So, here one might find scripts for experiments execution and notebooks with data visualization. The repository is organized according to the papers that I have published with my results. Here is a list with the available content:

1. [**A Quadratic Programming Approach for Microwave Imaging**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9362200): an implementation of Born Iterative Method using Quadratic Programming to solve the linear inverse problem (MATLAB). This formulation combines two kinds of regularization at the same time.

For any further information, you may e-mail me. More information will be provided later.
