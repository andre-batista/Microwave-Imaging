This is my repository of codes for my research in microwave imaging. Currently, it contains:

1. [**A Quadratic Programming Approach for Microwave Imaging**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9362200): The MATLAB codes implemented to run the experiments for the published paper.
2. **eispy2d**: the open-source Python library for development and comparison of algorithms in electromagnetic inverse scattering 

For any further information, you may e-mail me. More information will be provided later.
